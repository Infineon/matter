## Overview

Matter is an application-layer connectivity standard for increasing communication compatability between home devices. It was developed by a working group within the Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA), formerly known as the Zigbee Alliance.

This library extracts the core Matter SDK functionality and presents its use for Infineon devices.

## Features

* Functionality with Infineon's PSOC&trade; and AIROC&trade; devices.
* Use of Bluetooth&reg; Low Energy (LE), Wi-Fi standards.
* Out of the box support for Wi-Fi applications.

## Quick Start
