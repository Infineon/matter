# Matter 1.0.0

## Overview

Matter is an application-layer connectivity standard for increasing communication compatability between home devices. It was developed by a working group within the Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA), formerly known as the Zigbee Alliance.

This library extracts the core Matter SDK functionality and presents its use for Infineon devices.

## Features

* Functionality with Infineon's PSoC&trade; 6 devices and AIROC&trade; CYW30739.
* Use of Bluetooth&reg; Low Energy (LE), Wi-Fi, and Thread wireless connectivity standards.
* Out of the box support for Wi-Fi door lock, Thread door lock, and Thread lighting applications.

## Quick Start

Refer to the matter-wifi or matter-thread libraries as appropriate for the device being used.
